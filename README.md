# 🚀 Suraj Singh – Data Science Blog
## Link - https://suraj-data-science-blog.vercel.app/
This is my personal blog where I document my journey in **Data Science, Machine Learning, Analytics, and real-world projects**.

This is not a tutorial dump.  
This is a **learning-in-public log** of how I think, build, break, fix, and grow.

## 🌱 Why this blog?

Most people consume content.  
I believe in **building + documenting**.

This blog exists to:
- Deepen my own understanding
- Share practical learnings
- Document mistakes & fixes
- Build a strong personal brand in Data Science

If you’re learning too – you’re welcome to follow along.

## 🧠 What you’ll find here

- Data Science learning roadmaps  
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, EDA breakdowns  
- Machine Learning concepts explained simply  
- End-to-end project writeups  
- Debugging stories (because real life isn’t clean)  

Everything is based on **hands-on learning**, not theory-only content.
