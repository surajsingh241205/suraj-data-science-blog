# 📊 Statistics & Probability Roadmap for Data Science Freshers

This roadmap covers **everything a Data Science / Machine Learning fresher must know** in Statistics and Probability — from absolute basics to interview-critical concepts.

The focus is on **understanding + application**, not formula memorization.

---

## 🟢 LEVEL 0: Absolute Foundations (Must-Know)

### Descriptive Statistics
- Mean
- Median
- Mode
- Range

### Measures of Spread
- Variance
- Standard Deviation
- Interquartile Range (IQR)

Key understanding:
- Effect of outliers on mean vs median
- When to prefer median over mean

---

## 🟢 LEVEL 1: Data Shape & Distribution

### Distribution Basics
- Data distribution
- Frequency distribution
- Probability distribution (conceptual understanding)

### Normal Distribution
- Bell curve
- Mean, median, mode in normal distribution
- 68–95–99.7 rule

### Density Curve
- Interpretation of density plots
- Relationship between area and probability

---

## 🟢 LEVEL 2: Skewness & Outliers

### Skewness
- Symmetric distribution
- Right-skewed (positive skew)
- Left-skewed (negative skew)

### Outliers
- What are outliers
- IQR method for outlier detection
- Z-score method for outliers
- Impact of outliers on:
  - Mean
  - Variance
  - Machine Learning models

---

## 🟡 LEVEL 3: Probability Fundamentals

### Basic Probability
- Random experiment
- Sample space
- Event
- Probability rules
  - Addition rule
  - Multiplication rule

### Conditional Probability
- Definition of conditional probability
- Formula: P(A|B)
- Real-world intuition (medical testing, spam detection)

---

## 🟡 LEVEL 4: Bayes’ Theorem

- Bayes’ theorem formula
- Intuition behind Bayes’ theorem
- Prior, likelihood, posterior
- Real-world examples
- Importance in Naive Bayes algorithm

---

## 🟡 LEVEL 5: Random Variables & Probability Distributions

### Random Variables
- Discrete random variable
- Continuous random variable

### Probability Distributions
- Bernoulli distribution
- Binomial distribution
- Poisson distribution
- Normal (Gaussian) distribution

Understanding focus:
- When to use each distribution
- Real-world examples for each

---

## 🟠 LEVEL 6: Z-Score & Data Scaling

### Z-Score
- Z-score formula
- Interpretation of Z-score
- Z-score for outlier detection

### Data Scaling
- Standardization
- Normalization
- Difference between standardization and normalization
- Why scaling is required in ML
- Models sensitive to scaling:
  - KNN
  - SVM
  - Linear Regression
- Models not sensitive to scaling:
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest

---

## 🔴 LEVEL 7: Inferential Statistics

### Hypothesis Testing
- Null Hypothesis (H₀)
- Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)
- Significance level (α)
- p-value
- Decision rule in hypothesis testing

### Errors in Hypothesis Testing
- Type I Error (False Positive)
- Type II Error (False Negative)
- Real-world examples of both errors

---

## 🔴 LEVEL 8: Statistical Tests

### Types of Tests
- One-tailed test
- Two-tailed test

### Common Statistical Tests
- Z-test
- T-test
  - One-sample t-test
  - Two-sample t-test
- ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
  - One-way ANOVA
  - Why ANOVA is preferred over multiple t-tests

---

## 🔴 LEVEL 9: Correlation & Relationship Analysis

- Covariance
- Correlation
- Pearson correlation coefficient
- Spearman rank correlation
- Correlation vs causation
- Multicollinearity (basic understanding)

---

## 🟣 LEVEL 10: Statistics for Machine Learning Thinking

### Advanced Concepts (Fresher Advantage)
- Bias vs Variance tradeoff
- Sampling vs Population
- Central Limit Theorem (intuition level)
- Confidence Interval (conceptual understanding)

---

## 🎯 Final Notes

- Levels 0–7 are **mandatory for interviews**
- Levels 8–10 provide a **strong competitive edge**
- Focus on:
  - Intuition
  - Practical examples
  - Code-based validation
- Avoid memorizing formulas blindly

Statistics is the foundation of Machine Learning.  
**Strong statistics = confident ML decisions.**
