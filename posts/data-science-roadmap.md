# My Practical Data Science Learning Roadmap (From Beginner to Job-Ready)

If you are confused about where to start in Data Science, what to learn, and in what order – you are not alone.  
I was in the same place.

So instead of hoarding courses and watching random YouTube videos, I created a **clear, practical roadmap** that I follow.  
This post is a breakdown of that roadmap.

---

## Phase 1 – Python Foundations (Non-Negotiable)

Before touching ML or AI, you must be comfortable with:

- Variables, data types, loops, functions
- Lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets
- File handling
- Basic OOP

**Goal:**  
You should be able to write small scripts without Googling every line.

---

## Phase 2 – Data Handling with NumPy & Pandas

This is where real Data Science starts.

Learn:
- NumPy arrays, indexing, vectorization
- Pandas DataFrame, Series
- Filtering, sorting, grouping
- Handling missing values
- Merging and joining datasets

**Goal:**  
You should be able to take a raw CSV and clean it confidently.

---

## Phase 3 – Data Visualization

Because data is useless if you can’t explain it.

Tools:
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- (Later) Plotly for interactivity

Learn:
- Line plots, bar charts, histograms
- Box plots, heatmaps
- Trend analysis

**Goal:**  
You should be able to tell a story with data.

---

## Phase 4 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This is where you start thinking like an analyst.

Focus on:
- Understanding distributions
- Finding patterns
- Detecting outliers
- Asking the right questions

**Goal:**  
You should be able to say *why* something is happening, not just *what* is happening.

---

## Phase 5 – Statistics & Probability (Critical, Not Optional)

Most people skip this. Big mistake.

Learn:
- Mean, median, variance, standard deviation
- Probability basics
- Normal distribution
- Correlation
- Hypothesis testing

**Goal:**  
You should understand what your model is actually doing.

---

## Phase 6 – Machine Learning

Start with:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- KNN
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest

Then:
- Model evaluation
- Overfitting vs Underfitting
- Cross-validation

**Goal:**  
You should be able to train, evaluate, and explain a model.

---

## Phase 7 – Projects (This is Where Most People Fail)

Without projects, skills are useless.

Build:
- End-to-end ML projects
- Data analysis projects
- Dashboards
- Real datasets (not toy data)

**Goal:**  
You should have proof of work, not just certificates.

---

## Phase 8 – Advanced (Optional but Powerful)

- Deep Learning
- NLP
- RAG
- MLOps
- Deployment

Only after strong fundamentals.

---

## Final Advice

Do not chase everything at once.  
Do not compare your Chapter 1 with someone else’s Chapter 20.

Consistency beats intensity.

I am following this roadmap and documenting everything on this blog.  
If you are also learning Data Science, feel free to follow along.

Let’s build, not just consume.
