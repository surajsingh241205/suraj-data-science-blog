# Welcome to My Data Science Blog

This blog is where I document my learning journey in Data Science, Machine Learning, and real-world projects.

## Why this blog?

I believe in learning in public. Every concept I understand, every project I build, and every mistake I make — I will document it here.

## What you can expect:
- Practical explanations
- Real project breakdowns
- Clean Python code
- Honest learning experiences

Let’s build.
