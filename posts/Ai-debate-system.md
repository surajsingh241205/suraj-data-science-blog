# AI Debate System  
### Multi-Agent LLM Application

Live Link - [Ai Debate System](https://ai-debate-system.onrender.com/) <br>
Source Code - [GitHub](https://github.com/surajsingh241205/Ai-Debate-System)

An intelligent multi-agent debate platform where AI agents analyze a topic from opposing perspectives and a neutral judge evaluates the arguments and assigns scores.

This project demonstrates structured reasoning, adversarial analysis, and AI-based decision evaluation using modern Large Language Model (LLM) orchestration.

---

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Reasoning**
  - Agent A supports the statement
  - Agent B opposes the statement
  - Judge evaluates both sides neutrally

- **AI Score Meter**
  - Each agent receives a score (0–100)
  - Winner is declared with justification

- **Judge-Based Evaluation**
  - Structured verdict with logical explanation

- **Clean SaaS-Style UI**
  - Card-based layout
  - Clear separation of arguments
  - Professional dashboard appearance

- **Fast LLM Inference**
  - Powered by Groq LLM API

---

## System Architecture
```
User Input (Topic)
↓
Agent A (Supports Statement)
Agent B (Opposes Statement)
↓
Judge Agent (Evaluation + Scoring)
↓
Score Meter + Final Verdict
```

Each agent operates independently with a dedicated role prompt, ensuring unbiased and structured reasoning.
